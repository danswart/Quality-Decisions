Here are several sharp, clever analogies you can choose from — all designed to capture the absurdity of receiving a FOIA mountain of irrelevant material when you asked a precise question about the City Manager salary decision.

1. The Zoning Ordinance Analogy (refined)

“It’s like asking the city to explain a zoning ordinance and they hand you a dictionary, a globe, and wish you the best of luck.”

Clean, vivid, and nails the absurdity.



2. The Recipe Analogy

“It’s like asking a chef for the recipe for tonight’s soup and being handed the library’s entire cookbook section.
Somewhere in there is what you need — theoretically — but you’d starve before you found it.”



3. The Map Analogy

“It’s like asking for directions to City Hall and getting every map ever printed since 1850.
Sure, the answer is technically ‘in there,’ but it’s buried under layers of cartographic archaeology.”



4. The Medical Records Analogy

“It’s like asking your doctor whether your arm is broken and they hand you your entire medical history from birth.
Buried somewhere is the answer, but you’ll need a research team to find it.”



5. The Grocery Store Analogy

“It’s like asking the clerk where the eggs are and being told, ‘Everything you need is somewhere in aisle 1 through 47.’
Technically true, practically useless.”



6. The Library Card Catalog Analogy

“It’s like asking a librarian for a book on birds and being given the entire card catalog instead.
It contains what you asked for — theoretically — but only after days of decoding.”



7. The Puzzle Analogy

“It’s like asking for the picture on a puzzle box and being handed the puzzle pieces in a trash bag.
You could assemble it… someday.”



8. The Weather Forecast Analogy

“It’s like asking whether it will rain tomorrow and getting a dump of 40 years of meteorological data.
There’s an answer in there, but only if you moonlight as a climatologist.”



9. The Tax Analogy

“It’s like asking the city for your property tax bill and receiving the entire U.S. tax code instead.
Exhaustively complete, but hopelessly unhelpful.”



10. The Nail-and-Hammer Analogy

“It’s like asking for a nail and getting a Home Depot truck backed up to your driveway.
Somewhere in there is the nail. Good luck.”



Example:

“Requesting the decision criteria under FOIA was like asking for a zoning explanation and being handed a dictionary and a globe.

The city technically gave us ‘information,’ but none of it was organized or relevant enough to answer the question we actually asked.”
