## Overview

Use this rubric to rate the **quality of the decision-making process**, not the outcome.  
Each indicator is scored from **0 to 4**:

- **0 – Not addressed at all**  
- **1 – Mentioned, but incomplete or unclear**  
- **2 – Partially addressed; important gaps remain**  
- **3 – Mostly addressed; minor gaps**  
- **4 – Fully addressed; clear, thorough, and documented**

You may compute section subtotals and an overall score.
