## Decision Quality for Boards and Councils

- Our goal today: focus on the **quality of the decision process**, not just the outcome.
- A good outcome can come from a bad process.  
- A bad outcome can come from a careful, responsible process.

---

## The Central Question

> **Given what we knew at the time, was this a high-quality decision?**

We answer that by looking at seven areas:

1. Problem clarity  
2. Information quality  
3. Alternatives and tradeoffs  
4. Reasoning and analysis  
5. Procedural quality  
6. Community representation  
7. Documentation and transparency  

---

## 1. Problem Clarity

**Good practice**

- Clear statement of the decision question  
- Goals or success criteria are explicit  
- Links to adopted policies or strategic plans

**Red flags**

- Vague agenda item (“personnel matter”, “discussion only”)  
- No articulation of what success would look like

---

## 2. Information Quality

**Good practice**

- Information is directly relevant to the question  
- Covers key impacts, risks, and tradeoffs  
- Comes from credible, identifiable sources  
- Delivered in time for members to review

**Red flags**

- Massive data dump with no summary  
- Only one side of the story presented  
- Handouts distributed at the meeting for same-night action  

---

## 3. Alternatives and Tradeoffs

**Good practice**

- More than one option is presented (including status quo)  
- Benefits, costs, and risks of each option are compared  
- Reasons for rejecting options are explained

**Red flags**

- “We only have one realistic option.”  
- No “do nothing” or “delay” option considered  
- Little or no discussion of long-term consequences  

---

## 4. Reasoning and Analysis

**Good practice**

- Clear line from evidence → options → chosen action  
- Key assumptions are named and discussed  
- Uncertainty and risk are acknowledged

**Red flags**

- “Staff recommends this, so I move approval,” with no reasoning  
- No discussion of assumptions (e.g., future costs, enrollment, market conditions)  
- Motions passed after minimal discussion  

---

## 5. Procedural Quality

**Good practice**

- Members ask substantive, clarifying questions  
- Different viewpoints are encouraged and respected  
- Conflicts of interest are disclosed and managed  
- Established procedures and norms are followed

**Red flags**

- Rushed decisions without need  
- Cutting off questions or debate  
- Side conversations or decisions made outside the public meeting  

---

## 6. Community Representation

**Good practice**

- Impacted stakeholders are informed or consulted  
- Equity and fairness impacts are considered  
- The board is aware of how different groups may be affected

**Red flags**

- No opportunity for public input on major items  
- Groups heavily affected by the decision never appear in the discussion  
- Public comment is treated as a formality rather than a resource  

---

## 7. Documentation and Transparency

**Good practice**

- Minutes summarize reasoning, not just the vote  
- Key documents are retained and accessible to the public  
- An outside observer could reconstruct what happened and why

**Red flags**

- Minutes say only “discussion ensued” or “motion passed”  
- Supporting documents are hard to find or not posted  
- No written explanation of the rationale for major decisions  

---

## Using the Rubric

- Apply the rubric to **one past decision** as an exercise.  
- Score each section or simply mark “strong / adequate / weak”.  
- Ask:
  - Where are we strongest?  
  - Where are our recurring weak spots?  
  - What one or two habits would most improve our future decisions?

---

## Takeaways

- You can’t remove uncertainty from public decisions.  
- You **can** improve the clarity, fairness, and transparency of the process.  
- Over time, strong decision processes build:
  - Better outcomes on average  
  - Greater public trust  
  - A healthier governing culture
