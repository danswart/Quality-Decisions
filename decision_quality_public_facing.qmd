## Not Every Outcome Is Predictable – But Process Quality Is

Not every decision will turn out perfectly. New information appears, conditions change, and leaders are often working with uncertainty.

But we can still ask a fair question:

> **Was this a good decision at the time it was made, given what was known then?**

To answer that, we look at the **quality of the decision-making process**, not just the final result.

## Seven Questions for Citizens

### 1. Was the problem clear?

- Did the council clearly state what problem they were trying to solve?  
- Did they say what success would look like?

When the problem is vague, almost any solution can be justified. Clear problems make for better decisions.

---

### 2. Was the information good?

- Did the council receive information that directly addressed the question at hand?  
- Were short-term and long-term impacts discussed?  
- Were the numbers or facts from credible, identifiable sources?  
- Did members have time to read the material before the meeting?

A huge stack of documents is not the same as good information. Quality matters more than sheer volume.

### 3. Were real options considered?

- Did the council discuss more than one option, including “do nothing”?  
- Were different costs, benefits, and risks compared?  
- Were reasons for rejecting other options explained?

High-quality decisions almost always involve choosing between clearly described alternatives, not rubber-stamping a single proposal.

### 4. Was the reasoning explained?

- Could a reasonable person follow how the council went from “Here’s what we know” to “Here’s what we decided”?  
- Were key assumptions (for example, about costs or future conditions) made visible?  
- Were uncertainty and risk acknowledged?

Good governance means you can see the council’s logic, even if you might have chosen differently.

### 5. Was the process fair and well run?

- Did members ask real questions, not just offer praise?  
- Were different viewpoints allowed and treated respectfully?  
- Were conflicts of interest disclosed and managed appropriately?  
- Were basic procedures followed?

A strong process does not silence disagreement; it manages it constructively.

---

### 6. Was the community’s voice included?

- Were people and groups affected by the decision informed or given a chance to be heard?  
- Were equity and fairness considered?  
- Did the discussion reflect awareness of how different parts of the community might be affected?

Public decisions should reflect public interests, not just administrative convenience.

---

### 7. Is the decision transparent?

- Can an ordinary resident read the agenda, supporting documents, and minutes and understand what happened?  
- Is the reasoning recorded in some form, not just the final vote?  
- Are the key documents available without jumping through hoops?

Transparency builds trust. When the public can see **how** decisions were made, they are more likely to accept the result—even when they disagree.

## Why This Matters

Evaluating decisions using these process questions shifts the conversation from:

> “Did I personally like the outcome?”

to:

> “Did our city use a fair, informed, and transparent process to arrive at this decision?”

That is the foundation of accountable, democratic local government.
