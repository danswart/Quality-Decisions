⭐ THE KEY PRINCIPLE

The quality of a decision is judged by the quality of the process, not just the outcome.
(A good outcome can come from a poor process; a poor outcome can come from a good process.)

So we assess:

👉 Whether the information was complete, relevant, timely, unbiased, and understood
—not whether the final result happened to work out.

🔷 I. WHAT INFORMATION WAS PROVIDED?

Completeness and relevance

A high-quality decision requires information that is:

Relevant

Directly tied to the policy question

Includes alternatives and tradeoffs

Clearly connected to the stated goals

Complete

Includes fiscal, legal, operational, personnel, and community impact

Avoids cherry-picking

Covers both short- and long-term consequences

Appropriately summarized

Decision-makers receive synthesized, digestible material

Not buried in raw data dumps or irrelevant documents

🔍 Test questions:

“Did the information answer the actual decision question?”

“Was anything critical missing?”

“Was there unnecessary noise that obscured the signal?”

🔷 II. WHO PROVIDED THE INFORMATION?

Credibility and bias

Decision quality depends on:

Source credibility

Staff expertise

Independent evaluators

External consultants

Community stakeholders

Potential bias or conflict

Did the source benefit from the outcome?

Was opposing evidence represented fairly?

Diversity of viewpoints

Were dissenting or minority opinions included?

Were outside perspectives sought?

🔍 Test questions:

“Did the council rely on independent expertise or only internal voices?”

“Were vested interests allowed undue influence?”

🔷 III. HOW WAS THE INFORMATION ANALYZED?

Method and reasoning quality

High-quality decisions reflect:

Clear reasoning

Logical evaluation

Coherent explanation of how evidence supports the action

Structured analysis

Comparative evaluation of alternatives

Cost-benefit or cost-effectiveness analysis

Scenario analysis, including risks and uncertainties

Transparency of assumptions

What was assumed?

What was estimated?

What was unknowable?

Recognition of uncertainty

Explicit acknowledgment of risks

Consideration of what might go wrong

🔍 Test questions:

“Was there a clear ‘line of reasoning’ from evidence → conclusion?”

“Were assumptions explicit or hidden?”

🔷 IV. WHEN WAS THE INFORMATION PROVIDED?

Timeliness and decision pressure

Decision quality improves when:

Information is provided early enough

Council members have time to review

Questions can be asked

Alternatives can be considered

Not under artificial time pressure

Urgency is genuine, not manufactured

Updates are provided if conditions change

🔍 Test questions:

“Did council members have adequate time to digest the information?”

“Was anything rushed?”

🔷 V. WHERE DID THE INFORMATION COME FROM?

Data quality and transparency

Key considerations:

Traceability

Can the data source be verified?

Are documents publicly accessible?

Methodological quality

Are numbers derived from sound methods?

Are assumptions defensible?

Consistency

Do sources align?

Are conflicting sources explained?

🔍 Test questions:

“Are data sources disclosed and checkable?”

“Is the evidence internally consistent?”

🔷 VI. WHAT PROCESS DID THE DECISION-MAKERS FOLLOW?

Decision governance quality

Elements include:

Clear criteria for evaluation

What standards were used?

What goals were prioritized?

Deliberation quality

Were discussions substantive?

Were questions asked and answered?

Was dissent encouraged rather than punished?

Public transparency

Are rationale and materials accessible to the public?

Was the process visible and understandable?

🔍 Test questions:

“Could a reasonable outsider understand how the decision was made?”

“Was the process inclusive, respectful, and deliberative?”

🔷 VII. WHAT ALTERNATIVES WERE CONSIDERED?

Choice architecture

A decision is low quality if:

Only one option was presented

Alternatives were ignored or discouraged

Comparison was superficial or missing

High-quality decisions:

Articulate multiple courses of action

Explicitly compare benefits, costs, and consequences

Identify the option rejected and why

🔍 Test questions:

“Were multiple viable options evaluated?”

“Did the council choose the best among understood alternatives?”

🔷 VIII. HOW WELL WAS THE COMMUNITY’S INTEREST REPRESENTED?

Democratic responsiveness

Key indicators:

Stakeholder input

Public hearings

Citizen feedback

Impact on vulnerable groups

Alignment with adopted policy or values

Does the decision follow stated principles?

Equity and fairness considerations

🔍 Test questions:

“Would the community recognize their concerns in the final decision?”

“Were affected groups consulted or overlooked?”

🔷 IX. DOCUMENTATION OF THE DECISION

A high-quality decision leaves a trace

Good decisions include:

Clear written rationale

Explanation of tradeoffs

Identification of risks

Summary of alternatives

Justification for the chosen path

Poor decisions produce:

Vague minutes

No insight on reasoning

No clear evaluation criteria

Decisions that cannot be reconstructed
